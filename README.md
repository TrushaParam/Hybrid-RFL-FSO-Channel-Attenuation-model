This research project aims to develop models for a hybrid communication system that combines Radio Frequency (RF) and Free Space Optical (FSO) technologies. The goal is to improve data transmission rates and connection reliability for future wireless and satellite communications. Adverse weather conditions, especially rain-induced signal power reduction, can negatively impact the systemâ€™s performance. The project focuses on creating precise attenuation models for this hybrid RF/FSO system using a synthetic dataset derived from real-world empirical data obtained from operational systems in six different cities worldwide. The dataset includes information on RF and FSO channel attenuation, along with various weather parameters like temperature, humidity, visibility, etc. and also different weather conditions like clear sky, dust storms, fog, drizzle, rain, snow, and showers. By understanding how weather parameters have an effect on the hybrid RF/FSO communication system, this research contributes to improving wireless communication technologies, with potential applications in satellite communications. We came to the conclusion that using a Neural Network (tried FeedForward Neural Network) instead of a Random Forest can give good results.
